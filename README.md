#Gobly Modular Framework for Go

Gobly is a web framework concept that helps to build modular Go web applications. It aims to provide a set generic functions and utilities to develop loosely coupled modules using one generic user interface. Modules can be run either as single instance or in a complete application.

Gobly is using as many standard functions as possible and tries to be as transparent and lightweight as possible. In this sense, Gobly is not a complete framework, rather a set of tools to ease web development.


# Dependencies
Gobly depends on following third-party projects:

* [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux scripts) for routing
